# BarakoCafé
The project was proposed to hone my programming skills in the field of front end web development. Completing such project fills me a sense of achievement, but without a reward. As I am breaking barriers of my capabilities, what I will learn from this journey will be useful for the path I'm aiming for, but I might not be sure where that destination would be.

## Program Description
BarakoCafé is a website designed for a coffee shop opening for e-commerce. Made with React JS. Obviously, it doesn't aesthetically appeal like an actual website, maybe because of the choice of fonts, colors and components, it may also lack interactivity. I aim to improve the UI/UX design for this. Criticisms are appreciated.
